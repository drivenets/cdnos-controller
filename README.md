## Update cdnos controller image

### AWS

To update cdnos controller, update the image tag on makefile:
This line:

```
CONTROLLER_IMG ?= public.ecr.aws/dn/cdnos-controller:<your-tag>
```

Rebuild the image:

```sh
make docker-build
```

Connect to aws ecr registry:
```sh
aws ecr-public get-login-password --region us-east-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin public.ecr.aws/dn
```

Push image to registry:
```sh
make docker-push
```

We want to keep the latest tag updated so tag the image to `latest`:
```sh
docker tag public.ecr.aws/dn/cdnos-controller:<your-tag> public.ecr.aws/dn/cdnos-controller:latest
```

And push it to AWS ecr:
```sh
docker push public.ecr.aws/dn/cdnos-controller:latest
```

You should now be able to pull the image:

```sh
docker pull public.ecr.aws/dn/cdnos-controller:<your-tag>
```

### Manifest
We need to update the kubernetes manifest with the new image tag.
Modify this line in `config/manager/kustomization.yaml`:
```
newTag: "<your tag>"
```

Generate the manifest:
```sh
make generate-manifest
```

The new manifest is now available at this path: `config/manifests/manifest.yaml`.
