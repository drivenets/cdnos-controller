## Update cdnos controller image on AWS

To update cdnos controller, update the image tag on makefile:
This line:

```
CONTROLLER_IMG ?= public.ecr.aws/dn/cdnos-controller:<your-tag>
```

Rebuild the image:

```sh
make docker-build
```

Connect to aws ecr registry:
```sh
aws ecr-public get-login-password --region us-east-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin public.ecr.aws/dn
```

Push image to registry:
```sh
make docker-push
```

We want to keep the latest tag updated so tag the image to `latest`:
```sh
docker tag public.ecr.aws/dn/cdnos-controller:<your-tag> public.ecr.aws/dn/cdnos-controller:latest
```

And push it to AWS ecr:
```sh
docker push public.ecr.aws/dn/cdnos-controller:latest
```

You should now be able to pull the image:

```sh
docker pull public.ecr.aws/dn/cdnos-controller:<your-tag>
```
